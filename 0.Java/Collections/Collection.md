Collection Hierarchy

(Part of java.util.Collection interface)

This deals with storing groups of objects.

It is further divided into three main types:
A. List

Ordered, indexed, allows duplicates.

Use when you need positional access.

Examples: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack.

B. Set

Unordered, no duplicates allowed.

Use when uniqueness matters.

Examples: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet.

C. Queue

Follows FIFO (mostly).

Used for scheduling, processing tasks.

Examples: PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque.
